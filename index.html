    <h1>CS 210 Project: Analyzing Tweeting Patterns</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my data science project! Below are visualizations representing various aspects of the data analysis. The visualizations 
        are all interactive, so they may take some time to load.</p>

    <h2>Description of the Dataset</h2>

    <p>I obtained this data by requesting it from my Twitter archive. It ranges from mid-2019 to November 2023. There is a period that seems to be ‘missing‘ in the data, but
        it is organically missing. This means that it was not present in the archive to begin with. The reason for this is that I had deleted a lot of my twetes of that periodon my own
        a couple of years ago.</p>
    
       <p>The dataset consisted of around 12800 tweets and retweets. The raw data can not be disclosed for privacy concerns, but each tweet had an associated number of likes, number of 
    retweets, classified language, hashtags and mentions. Another set of data I used was that concerned with advertisements which consisted of around 24000 instances of advertisements over the period of me
       having Twitter, approximately 7 years.</p>

    <p>This data can be found in the GitHub repository for this website under /data.</p>

     <h2>Make-Up of My Tweets</h2>
    <p>This visualization shows how many of my tweets are original tweets, replies, private quotes, public quotes, or retweets.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweet-distribution.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>This becomes interesting information after I explain why I would choose to do a circle quote versus a public quote. If I make a circle quote, visible only to people in my
    circle, which used to be an old Twitter feature, I would often be very critical, to put it nicely, of what I'm quoting. In other words, this shows the fraction representing the number
    of times I expressed my aggressive criticism in comparison to all of my expressions.</p>
    
    <p>A more in-depth analysis here would require that this frequency is mapped over time to see how my online attitudes are changing over time if they are changing. The tweets/retweets attitude is already mapped below, and adding the quotes and replies would add a lot more to the analysis.</p>
    
    <p>The overwhelming majority of the tweets are either original tweets or replies. This can suggest a connection with my audience, which has truth in it as most of my followers are my friends who I interact with on regular basis. It makes sense to be this engaging. In order to explore this further, the replies can be mapped to users and a network can be established to see whether or not most replies are directed to the same group of people or not.</p>

       <h2>Mode Hour</h2>
    <p>Over time, the hour during which I tweeted the most changed. However, there's still a peak that remained pretty much the same: evening.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/mode-hour-resized.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>This is a very detailed graph that shows the hour during which I tweeted most for every day in the dataset. Often, the peaks would be around the same time for consecutive days, given
    that I am a person who has a routine. Because of my routine, it would make sense that most tweets are either early morning or around evening.</p>
    
    <p>We can see some patterns that map to events in my life. During my A Level exams, there were many fluctuations in my routine, which can be seen in the visible May-June periods in 2021 and 2022. During summers, we'll have more points during the early hours of the morning in comparison to winter. In winter 2022, I would never be up before 06:00, so all of the points are away from that time.
    </p>

    <p>This is one of the more informative graph in this analysis thus far. Here are some takeaways:</p>
    <p>1. I use Twitter on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>2. For a number of consecutive days, the hour during which I tweet most, denoted as "mode hour", are close. This means that I keep a somewhat stable routine. This does not perfectly apply to the first half of the dataset, when I was doing my A Levels and had a very simultanous routine unlike when I started university and established a routine, somewhat. Again, comparison with my Google Calendar data will bring a lot more depth to this analysis.</p>
    <p>3. My peak activity would be either early morning or evening. It is quite rare for me to be heavily active at night, which suggests that I do not use Twitter much past midnight. This only happens very rarely and at odd times.</p>

    <h2>Likes and Retweets per Day</h2>
    <p>This chart shows the distribution of likes and retweets per day.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/likes-and-retweets-per-day.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>The number of tweets is somewhat constant with some sudden peaks every once in a while. These peaks are always due to Tweets that became popular for any reason. Mostly, these tweets
    were jokes or silly screenshots.</p>

      <h2>Number of Tweets versus Number of Retweets</h2>
    <p>It's interesting to see how this pattern changes during big events. As an Egyptian, it was expected that I react during the Egyptian MeToo movement and 
        again during the devaluation of the currency in October of 2022. The Israeli aggression on Gaza also led to a rise in the number of retweets in comparison to tweets,
        and this might be because I'm not a professional on the matter, so I retweet rather than say something new. A number of tweets generally decreased during that period too, 
        which makes sense as well. I find it shameful to tweet like I usually would when people are being massacred, so I didn't tweet as much.</p>

    <p>There is also a peak around the Summer of 2023 which is a time I strongly reconnected with friends back home through online activity.</p>
    
    <iframe src="Figures/tweets-versus-retweets.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <p>One would think that this graph and the previous graph should align, but they don't. This might be because of the audience difference. When I first started actively tweeting, I did not
    have much of a following, unlike now. This can explain the general rise in likes and thus explain why these graphs are not as complimentary as they should be intuitively.</p>

        <h2>Correlation Matrix</h2>
        <p>There's a positive correlation between likes and retweets which makes perfect sense.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/correlation-matrix.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <h2>Tweets by Date-Time</h2>
    <p>This plot contains all of my activities since 2019. The bigger circles represent more tweets, and each day has a circle for each hour I was active during.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweets-by-datetime.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>Some days only had one hour of activity, others had more. This graph can be used to tell more information about my routine. How often I tweet in the morning can suggest how free or
    busy I am in the mornings. The circle sizes represent the day number of tweets. To see the specific hour, the graph needs to be zoomed in.</p>
    <p>Some events have famous timestamps. For example, the first wave of the second devaluation of the Egyptian Pound happened around midday mid-October. An online reaction should be expected in the following hours, and we can confirm this with content analysis. Now, the missing information is what kind of events are we looking for. If we are able to map out dates for events, we can see if a user responded to these events and how strongly they responded to them and how strongly their followers did as well by comparing content analysis (to confirm that this is indeed a response) to activity.</p>

    <h2>Tweets by Hour</h2>
    <p>This plot shows the cumulative sum of tweets produced per each since 2019. This aligns with any activity graph shown so far which shows that I am most active during the evening.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweets-by-hour.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>This graph is the shallow version of the mode hour graph, and it is not that misleading. Often, the surface-level analysis can be misleading and give us false leads to conclusions, but in-depth analysis confirmed that there is an ongoing trend of being most active during these hours.</p>

    <h2>Language Distribution</h2>
    <p>This graph shows the language distribution of my tweets. Twitter classifies tweets into languages using language models. However, this visualization is incredibly misleading. If it measures anything, it measures the incompatibility of this model with
        multilingual instances of data. The graph shows how many times I tweeted in a certain language.</p>
    <p>I do not know any languages other than English, Arabic, and French, so this is a very interesting graph! 
        The reason for this misclassification by Twitter is that I sometimes use Romanized Arabic which is always misinterpreted as another language.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweets-by-language.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>This graph shows one why NLP is a very hard task on this dataset. The content of the tweets is multilingual. One tweet can mix up to three languages and two different writing scripts. Being able to process such data without ruining its uniqueness is a very hard task. Here's an example of a tweet you can find:</p>

    <p>"i'm genuinely so sick of uni begad تعبت, men albi te3ebt. leghayet hena w begad merci."</p>

    <p>This tweet is a mixture of English, Arabic, Romanized Arabic (Egyptian dialect) and French. Being able to separate it without ruining the data is very hard. However, we are very close to getting meaningful analysis out of the tweet content. This is currently in the works.</p>

        <h2>Which emojis do I use most?</h2>
    <p>Explore the emoji usage patterns in my tweets.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/emoji-usage.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>This graph is very funny. The reason the crying emoji is the most used one is that I use it when I find something funny, which seems to be very often. I usually use a few in one message, not just one,
    explaining the high number. However, I use the laughing emoji when I am being sarcastic or making fun of something, and this also applies to the "rolling on the floor laughing" emoji. What we can conclude is
    that I should learn to be nicer. :)</p>
    <p>So far, we can tell that I am not a very nice Tweeter. Sentiment analysis might confirm this if only ran on the original posts and not replies, knowing myself. The emojis strongly show this. In comparison to the number of tweets I have, the number of hearts I used is disproportionate in comparison to sarcastic emojis. This is something that I learnt about myself from the dataset.</p>

    <h2>Advertisement Frequency</h2>
    <p>This graph shows how often a specific targeting value was used in advertisements I was shown. Location, obviously, was mostly used.</p>
    <p>This means that my location being in Turkey was very relevant to ad targeting and was very heavily utilized as it was more relevant to tge ads. This can help us draw some picture about my timeline.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/advertisement-frequency.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <p>We can infer so much information from this graph. We can infer that:</p>
    <p>1. I'm an iPhone user.</p>
    <p>2. I have lived in Turkey and Egypt.</p>
    <p>3. I'm an adult.</p>
    <p>4. I'm interested in enterpreneurship, politics and literature.</p>
    <p>5. I speak Arabic and English.</p>
    
    <p>We can infer a lot more than this too. This is the analysis at a glance.</p>

    <!-- Line break -->
    <br>

    <h2>Advertisement Targeting</h2>
    <p>This shows how often each targeting category was used to show me advertisements. A targeting category can be "interests" or "keywords" relevant to me.</p>
    <p>Without information about how targetting is done, this graph is not really valuable. It might be a general trend where interests and then keywords are used to target users. Interest usually lies in topics or locations. For example, if I have an interest in politics and graduate
        studies, I'll see an ad from some university. Keywords are usually, not always, standalone interests. For example, "money" can be a keyword. If anything, keywords and interests are very similar.
    </p>
    <iframe src="Figures/advertisement-targeting.html" width="100%" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    
    <p>Most of the targeting, as shown in the previous graph, was relevant to location and device, which makes sense when we look at this graph. The location and device were often in the "keywords" and "interests" categories. The distribution for other categories is
    pretty low, almost negligible, in comparison.</p>
    <p>The categorization of targets is not consistent in the dataset as some targeting values belong to more than one category and are categorized differently each time. The previous visualization definitely gives more information about who I am.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Mostly, my graphs confirm what I know about myself. I'm usually active towards the evening, and sometimes ea I don't tweet as much during
    a human rights disaster but rather retweet. I tweet a lot when a crisis happens in Egypt, my home. The data confirms all of this. I also had some personal issues in the Summer
    of 2023, and I found solace in my friends, which explains the general rise in tweet rate that can be observed during that period. Sentiment analysis of the tweets would have confirmed
    that. Preliminary analysis showed very negative sentiments during this period in comparison to others.</p>

    <p>I plan on adding the result of the natural language analysis as I am sure that this will show a lot more than the quantitative analysis. However, given the multilingual nature of the
    dataset, this is proving difficult as the applicable approaches will kill the uniqueness of my dataset. The current approach is to transliterate the Romanized Arabic to proper Arabic and
    use Arabic NLP models to analyze it.</p>

    <p>Generally, the data obtained so far shows a lot about my patterns and routines. My routine can be traced from my activity on Twitter, which is where I'm most active out of all
    social media platforms. The next step would be analyzing the tweets during peak activity and establishing a scheme that is able to predict whether or not I will be active and responsve
    on Twitter given some happenings.</p>

    <p>The lost data in 2021 would add so much to the analysis, but they have been permanently deleted, unfortunately. Ways to recover such data should be explored to have a more complete picture. What we have right now is a puzzle with missing pieces. Patterns of tweeting, rewteeting and general engagement changed drastically when we compare the before and after. The change should not be drastic, logically, so this needs to be explored.</p>
