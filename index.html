    <h1>Data Science Project Visualizations</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my data science project! Below are visualizations representing various aspects of the data analysis. The visualizations 
        are all interactive, so they may take some time to load. Data is from 2019 onwards. The missing sections in the graph are a result 
        of organically missing data and not dropped data.</p>

    <h2>Likes and Retweets per Day</h2>
    <p>This chart shows the distribution of likes and retweets per day.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/likes-and-retweets-per-day.html" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <h2>Mode Hour</h2>
    <p>Over time, the hour during which I tweeted the most changed. However, there's still a peak that remained pretty much the same: *evening*.</p>

    <h2>Make-Up of My Tweets</h2>
    <p>This visualization shows how many of my tweets are original tweets, replies, private quotes, public quotes, or retweets.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweet-distribution.html" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <h2>Tweets by Date-Time</h2>
    <p>This plot contains all of my activities since 2019. The bigger circles represent more tweets, and each day has a circle for each hour I was active during.</p>
    <iframe src="Figures/tweets-by-datetime.html" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <h2>Tweets by Hour</h2>
    <p>This plot shows the number of tweets produced per each since 2019.</p>

    <h2>Language Distribution</h2>
    <p>I do not know any languages other than English, Arabic, and French, so this is a very interesting graph! 
        The reason for this misclassification by Twitter is that I sometimes use _romanized Arabic_ which is always misinterpreted as another language.</p>

    <h2>Number of Tweets versus Number of Retweets</h2>
    <p>It's interesting to see how this pattern changes during big events. As an Egyptian, it was expected that I react during the Egyptian MeToo movement and 
        again during the devaluation of the currency in October of 2022. The Israeli aggression on Gaza also led to a rise in the number of retweets in comparison to tweets,
        and this might be because I'm not a professional on the matter, so I retweet rather than say something new. Number of tweets generally decreased during that period too, 
        which makes sense as well. I find it shameful to tweet like I usually would when people are being massacred, so I didn't tweet as much.</p>

    <h2>Advertisement Frequency</h2>
    <p>This graph shows how often a specific targeting value was used in advertisements I was shown. Location, obviously, was mostly used.</p>

    <h2>Advertisement Targeting</h2>
    <p>This shows how often each targeting category was used to show me advertisements. A targeting category can be "interests" or "keywords" relevant to me.</p>

    <h2>Takeaways!</h2>
    <p>Mostly, my graphs confirm what I know about myself. I'm usually active towards the evening, and sometimes early morning. I don't tweet as much during
    a human rights disaster, but rather retweet. I tweet a lot when a crisis happens in Egypt, my home. The data confirms all of this. I also had some personal issues in the Summer
    of 2023, and I found solace in my friends, which explains the general rise of tweet rate that can be observed during that period. Sentiment analysis of the tweets would have confirmed
    that.</p>
